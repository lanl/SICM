#!/bin/bash
# This wrapper is intended to be used with the compiler_wrapper.sh and
# ld_wrapper.sh. It wraps the `ar` utility, and can be used in a build
# system that uses `ar` to archive a bunch of `.o` files, then links
# those together into the final executable.
# It works by simply archiving both the `.o` files that it was given,
# as well as the accompanying `.bc` files. These `.bc` files should
# have been output by `compiler_wrapper.sh`. Then, `ld_wrapper.sh`
# will extract these `.bc` files from the archive, transform them,
# recompile them into `.o` files, and re-archive them.
# It also includes the `.args` files in the archive, so that `ld_wrapper.sh`
# knows which arguments to use when recompiling the object files.
