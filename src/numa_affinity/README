The script numa_measure.sh is a combination of three programs to classify numa nodes based on its affininty to processors and accelerators.
It identifies CPU sets by parsing output of numactl -H.
It runs the gpu-numa program in gpu-test folder which associates a GPU to its NUMA memory.
Then it runs the affinuma program in the affinuma folder to label numa nodes as fast, slow and slowest by measuring bandwidth for every numa node and CPU sets combination.
Then it runs the affigpu program in the affigpu folder to label numa nodes as fast, slow and slowest by measuring bandwidth for every numa node and GPU device combination.
Sample Output:

This program runs for all compute devices (Intel, AMD, IBM) but not ARM. (TODO: Add support form ARM)
This program classifies only Nvidia GPUs. (TODO: Add support for Radeon and Intel GPUs)
